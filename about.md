I am a Software Developer based in Bangalore, India. I started Software Development 2 years and 9 months ago (as of 10 July, 2019). I am really passionate about problem solving and contributing to the community.

I have worked extensively with Flutter and Dart and as such have in depth knowledge of the platform. I am also experienced in back-end development with Node.
